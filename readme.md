# Django Application Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

This example demonstrates how to set up monitoring for a Django application using Prometheus and Grafana. You can use this as a template for implementing monitoring in your own Django projects.

## Setup

1. **Django Application**:
   - Ensure your Django application is ready for monitoring.
   - Install the necessary Python packages:
     ```
     pip install prometheus-client django-prometheus
     ```
   - Configure your Django application as mentioned in the previous instructions.

2. **Prometheus**:
   - Create a `prometheus.yml` configuration file to specify scrape targets and other settings. Make sure it's correctly formatted.
   - Build the Prometheus Docker image:
     ```
     docker build -t my-prometheus ./prometheus
     ```
   - Start the Prometheus container:
     ```
     docker run -d -p 9090:9090 --name my-prometheus my-prometheus
     ```

3. **Grafana**:
   - Create dashboard and data source configurations (e.g., `my-dashboard.json` and `my-datasource.yml`) in the `grafana/` directory.
   - Build the Grafana Docker image:
     ```
     docker build -t my-grafana ./grafana
     ```
   - Start the Grafana container:
     ```
     docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name my-grafana my-grafana
     ```

4. **Access Metrics**:
   - Access the Prometheus metrics at `http://localhost:9090/metrics`.
   - Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` and configure it to use Prometheus as the data source. Import the dashboard using the `my-dashboard.json` file.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting steps in the provided documentation.
- Check the container logs for Prometheus and Grafana using `docker logs my-prometheus` and `docker logs my-grafana`, respectively.

This example provides a basic setup for monitoring a Django application. Customize the configurations and dashboard as needed for your specific use case.
